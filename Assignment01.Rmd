# **Introducction**
For this document, we are going to replicate maps in academic publications/working papers in economics. The main goal of this work is to put in practice the sf tools to work with vector data.

# **Development** 
In this section there are all the maps that we replicated and, previously, the codes we used to obtained them. 

We are calling the libraries we will use.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(foreign)
library(tidyverse)

setwd("C:/Users/Enzo/Documents/BSE/T2/GEOSPATIAL_SPATIAL_MODELS/S03/HW")

path <- getwd()
path_data <- file.path(path, "data") 
```

## **Hydro dams in South Africa**
## **Districts and electricity grid in Ethiopia**
## **Population in Brazil's meso-regions**
## **Vietnam's road infrastructure by road type**
## **Brazil's capital and main road infrastructure**
```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sf.brazil <- st_read(paste0(path_data, "/p5/SNV_202001A.shp"))
summary(sf.brazil)

# View the first few rows of the attribute table
head(sf.brazil)

# Plot the shapefile
plot(sf.brazil)
```
